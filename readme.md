# Pavel is Learning Serverless
## About
This is my sandbox for learning AWS.  
I am currently following a tutorial on 
[how to build a serverless and imgur clone](https://tutorialedge.net/projects/building-imgur-clone-vuejs-nodejs/part-1-project-setup/). I hope to grow this further once I am done. 


## Running 
To run the the frontend, execute `npm run serve` from the `~/frontend` directory

To run the backend, execute `node index.js` from the `~/backend` directory
